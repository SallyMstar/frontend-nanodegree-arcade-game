<h2>The mission:</h2>
     You are our hero mouse!  It's your job to scramble across the open field and stone path to make it to the safety of the water.  The cats want to eat you, but they won't go into the water!

<h2>How to play:</h2>
     Use the arrow keys to control your character.  You can go up, down, left, and right, but if you run into a cat, you'll be kitty kibble!
